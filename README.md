XY Pen Plotter: Drawing Nicolus House
Project Overview: An XY pen plotter designed to draw a detailed illustration of Nicolus House.
Motors Used: Utilizes DC motors for movement control instead of stepper motors.
Controllers: Controlled by both an ESP32 microcontroller and an Arduino for coordinating the plotter's actions.
Drawing Process: Converts digital coordinates into precise physical drawings, replicating the Nicolus House design.
Technology: Demonstrates the use of DC motors and a dual-controller setup (ESP32 + Arduino) for automated drawing.
Objective: Showcases the ability to create intricate designs with an efficient and low-cost plotter system.
